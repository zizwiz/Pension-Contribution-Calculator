# Pension-Contribution-Calculator
An app to help me calculate what I should pay into my pension fund. 

Recently started a new job and a chance to look at how much I need to pay into the pension fund. A rather complicated thing as some of my pay is now in a bonus and this is not known till the end of the year. A good bonus may push me into the next tax bracket so I need to take that into account. The app does not have all the bells and whistles in it as I just did enough to help me answer my questions. It will not work properly if your annual salary is over Â£150000 but as I am unlikely to ever reach that I did not work on it. If you are lucky to earn that amount then please feel free to adjust the code to take it into account.

The app is based on UK tax and national insurance as at September 2022 as best as the info I can find. Do change it for the latest figures if you have them.
